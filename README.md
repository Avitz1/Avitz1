#### Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am a computer science graduate with a passion for software development and technology.\
My primary areas of interest are software engineering, machine learning, and Cyber Security.\
I am actively seeking opportunities to collaborate with like-minded individuals and organizations in these domains.

On this profile, you will find a collection of my personal projects, as well as contributions to open source projects.\
I believe that collaboration is the key to unlocking the full potential of technology, and I am always looking for ways to contribute to the community.

If you are interested in collaborating on a project, or have any questions or comments about my work, please feel free to reach out [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avi-lifshitz-haifa/).\
I am always happy to connect with other developers and share ideas.
